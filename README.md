# Unit 6: Housing Rental Analysis for San Francisco


## Background of Project 

**Proptech**, the application of technology to real-estate markets, is an innovative domain in the fintech industry. Assume that you’re an analyst at a proptech company that wants to offer an instant, one-click service for people to buy properties and then rent them. The company wants to have a trial of this offering in the San Francisco real estate market. If the service proves popular, they can then expand to other markets.

Your job is to use your data visualization skills, including aggregation, interactive visualizations, and geospatial analysis, to find properties in the San Francisco market that are viable investment opportunities.

For this homework assignment, you’ll need to create and submit the following deliverable:

* A Jupyter notebook that contains your analysis of the housing rental market data for San Francisco. The analysis will be complete with professionally styled and formatted interactive visualizations.

### Details of Implementation 

I have used the `san_francisco_housing.ipynb` notebook to visualize and analyze the real-estate data and submit my analysis for the same purpose and i have used hvPolt and GeoViews to implment these visualizations. 

* I have Calculated and plot the housing units per year.

* I have Calculated and plot the average prices per square foot.

* I have Compared the average prices by neighbourhood.

* I have used Geoviews to build an interactive neighbourhood map.

* The Details of the Story are as below. 

### Responses to questions presented. 

**The review of the rental income seems to relects a trend of increasing rental incoming acorss the all the districts between 2010 and 2016 while the sales price seems to fluctuate based on neighbourhoods in the city but have an increasing trend since 2012 onwards.**

**The ideal investment will be a place which has low cost of purchase or per square foot value and high return on rental income and after careful consideration, i would recommend to them to invest into **Silver Terrace** followed by **Hunters Point** to invest in buy-and-rent strategy due to **low cost of average per square foot price over 5 years and increasing trend in rental income.**
